# scicode-learn
:star2: Welcome! :star2:

The goal of **scicode-learn** is to be an aggregation website for scientific programming resources. The project is particularly geared towards intro-to-programming material and guides that are more field-specific (e.g., making psychology experiments, data analyses for genetics research, etc.). The website will aggregate resources—from cheatsheets to online courses—across Python, Matlab, and R.

The project is still early on, see the initial roadmap ([issue #2](https://github.com/scicode-learn/scicode-learn/issues/2)) for the plan to get the project off the ground.

scicode-learn a riff off of #scicode and scikit-learn. (See this [blog post](https://medium.com/@cMadan/scicode-learn-collecting-thoughts-ff22443f3dda) for some thoughts on the original inspiration for the project.)


### Why should I learn to program?

Being able to program your analysis definitely involves a learning curve, but with some practice, programming could save you weeks of manual effort, make you more self sufficient, and could even make some otherwise unfeasible analyses possible. Additionally, programming is an important facet of conducting reproducible research. Reproducibility is an important facet of scientific research, but non-computational workflows are difficult to construct as reproducible pipelines. By having a better understanding of scientific programming, we hope that scientists will be better able to conduct their research and share their analysis methods with others.
